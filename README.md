## Design Methodology

The choice of maps, charts, and graphs in the Interactive Data Dashboard is grounded in ease of interpretability, effectiveness in communicating complex data relationships, and alignment with specific data types. Each visualization was selected to make the data exploration process intuitive and to enable users to gain insights quickly.

### Maps

1. **Dot Map**
   - **Purpose**: Visualize population concentrations within selected countries by plotting each city with a dot size proportional to its population.
   - **Data Suitability**: Location-based data like city population sizes, where each dot is both a precise location and a quantity.

2. **Proportional Symbol Map**
   - **Purpose**: Overlay circles on countries based on population, with color intensity reflecting GDP values. This enables dual comparisons of population size and economic output.
   - **Data Suitability**: Ideal for comparing data across regions of varying sizes, where larger symbols indicate greater magnitude.

3. **Choropleth Map**
   - **Purpose**: Display health expenditure across countries, with color intensity representing expenditure levels.
   - **Data Suitability**: Suitable for regional or national data with continuous values, such as percentages or rates.

### Charts & Graphs

4. **Treemap**
   - **Purpose**: Show city populations, grouped by country, highlighting how urban areas contribute to national population sizes.
   - **Data Suitability**: Effective for visualizing part-to-whole relationships within hierarchical data.

5. **Sunburst Chart**
   - **Purpose**: Display population data by country, year, and demographic segments in a hierarchical format.
   - **Data Suitability**: Best for hierarchical or multi-level data, enabling drill-down exploration.

6. **Zoomable Circle Packing**
   - **Purpose**: Show population data by gender within each country, with zoom functionality.
   - **Data Suitability**: Effective for nested or grouped data requiring visual hierarchy without complex comparisons.

7. **Pie Chart**
   - **Purpose**: Break down a countryâ€™s total population by its top cities to visualize relative size and distribution.
   - **Data Suitability**: Ideal for categorical data that represent parts of a whole, with limited categories for comparison clarity.

8. **Stacked Bar Chart**
   - **Purpose**: Visualize health expenditure across countries over time, comparing category contributions to a total.
   - **Data Suitability**: Suited for time series data with categories where both individual and cumulative values are important.

9. **Difference Chart**
   - **Purpose**: Highlight expenditure differences between two countries over time.
   - **Data Suitability**: Best for paired comparisons, showing trends and deviations.

10. **Force-Directed Graph**
    - **Purpose**: Visualize migration connections between countries, with line thickness representing migration volume.
    - **Data Suitability**: Suitable for network data, emphasizing connection strength between entities.

11. **Multi-Line Chart**
    - **Purpose**: Display trade data trends, such as imports and exports, over time.
    - **Data Suitability**: Time series data where trends and changes are essential.

12. **Parallel Coordinates Chart**
    - **Purpose**: Show migration data across metrics like origin, destination, age, and gender.
    - **Data Suitability**: Effective for multi-dimensional comparisons across multiple variables.

13. **Chord Diagram**
    - **Purpose**: Visualize migration flows between countries, with arc thickness proportional to migration volume.
    - **Data Suitability**: Ideal for data with flow or connection strength between entities.

14. **Migration Map**
    - **Purpose**: Show migration flows between countries with directional markers.
    - **Data Suitability**: Geographic data focused on movement or flow between locations.

- **City Populations and Demographics**: Used in Dot Map and Pie Chart for city-wise population visualizations.

### Creating Configuration Files
The following configuration files are created and posted in the repository:

1. **Create webpack.config.js**

   This file is the configuration for Webpack, defining how your project is bundled. It specifies the entry point, output directory, module rules for processing different file types, and the plugins used to generate the HTML file.

2. **Create .babelrc File**

   This file contains the configuration for Babel, which is used to transpile modern JavaScript and React code into a backward-compatible version. It specifies the presets that Babel should use for transforming the code.

3. **Update package.json**

   This file manages your project's dependencies and scripts. The scripts section should be updated to include commands for starting the development server, building the project for production, and deploying to GitHub Pages.

These files are essential for ensuring that the project builds and runs correctly and are included in the repository for reference.
